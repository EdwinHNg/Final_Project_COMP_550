\subsection*{Sentiment Analysis on News and Social Media for Bitcoin Price Prediction}
\par \qquad In recent years, Bitcoin has gained enormous popularity. After receiving many media coverages in 2017, the  price went up drastically from USD 1,000 to USD 20,000, from which it has since gone down. In fact, this sudden increase in price is not surprising since behavioral economics states that there are correlation between the public sentiment and the market, in addition to news information. Fortunately, with the advent of social media, the information about public feelings has become abundant, where Twitter has received a lot of attention from researchers. Thus, the plan of the project is as followed. We will conduct sentiment analysis on both news and tweets from Twitter in order to better reflect the public opinion.
